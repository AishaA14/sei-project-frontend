## Brief

This project was developed as part of my coding bootcamp curriculum. The project's goal was to create a user-friendly online library where fans could contribute and manage entries related to the One Piece series, specifically the Devil Fruits.

## Planning

### Initial Steps

Before diving into the code, I took some time to plan out the website. This planning stage was crucial for understanding how the website would work, defining its logic, and ensuring a smooth development process.

### Sketches and Diagrams

I used Excalidraw, a collaborative whiteboard tool, to create visual sketches and diagrams that helped me visualize the website's components and user interactions. These sketches allowed me to map out the following key aspects of the website:
